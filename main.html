    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure in computer science that quantifies the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. An algorithm is considered efficient if its runtime is short relative to the problem's inherent difficulty, or more efficient than its alternatives.</p>
    <p><b>Space complexity measures the total amount of memory space an algorithm uses during its execution relative to the size of the input. The notation O(n), pronounced "Big O of n" or "order of n," indicates that the algorithm's memory consumption is directly proportional to the input size, \(n\).</b></p>

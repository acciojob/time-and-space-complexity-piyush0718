  <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm grows with input size. It helps us evaluate how efficient an algorithm is, especially when dealing with large datasets.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to its input size. For example, an algorithm with space complexity of O(n) uses memory that grows linearly with the input.
